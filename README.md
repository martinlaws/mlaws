## ☕️ tl;dr

This is the source code for [mlaws.ca](https://mlaws.ca). Look around! Make yourself at home. Let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/martinblaws) or by [email](mailto:hey@mlaws.ca) if you want to get in touch, or feel free to create an issue on this repo. The site is built with Gatsby and doesn't use a CMS.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

- **Wes Bos' [Master Gatsby course](https://mastergatsby.com/) is kick ass.** I think it's worth every penny, and covers the whole Gatsby ecosystem (Sanity CMS, `styled-components`, handling images).
